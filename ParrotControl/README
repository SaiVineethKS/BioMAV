 1.0 The directory and its contents
------------------------------------

The directory contains programs that allow to control the drone directly via a 
joystick and/or libraries that provide an application programming interface to
Java. Details of the different projects can be found in the corresponding
directories or in the next subjections of this file.

-------------------
 1.1 GroundStation
-------------------

This project contains a library which should provide API to a Java environment
using the original Parrot AR.Drone SDK (complied with 1.6). However, we did not
succeed to create a stable build of the Parrot AR.Drone on our buildsystem
(Ubuntu 11.4) so this program was abandoned due to stability issues.

However, the JNI-library from this project still was used in our final project 
to expose the SDL-based joystick control to Java.

-------------------
 1.2 RemoteControl
-------------------

The stable, pure-Java implementation of the communication layer with the Parrot
AR.Drone. It provides a Java interface to control and retrieve navdata and
camera images from the drone. Therefore, it uses parts from the JavaDrone-
project obtainable under the BSD license at http://code.google.com/p/javadrone/

The program implements the communication layer compatible with the 1.6-SDK
firmware.

-------------------
 1.3 RemoteControl
-------------------

Standalone program using the original AR.Drone SDK to control the drone and
receive navdata and images. Pretty much was only to test the capabilities of
the original SDK. Did nut run completely stable under Ubuntu 11.04 either. 
However, can contribute some fun as a pure remote control program.
