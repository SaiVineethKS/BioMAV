 1.0 Project Description
-------------------------

This project is a Java API, which exposes functions to Java that allow to
remote control the Parrot AR.Drone. The project is aimed at compatibility to
the 1.6 release of the Parrot AR.Drone SDK and is programmed for the largest
part in Java. The long-term goal is to implement the image decoding process
in C++ and tramit the decoded images to Java using a JNI that can be compiled
under all major operating systems.

 2.0 Buildguide 
----------------

Using the Makefile

(TODO)

Using a Java development IDE

1. Build the jar file from the base-package
2. Import the Java source from this directory
3. Add the base-jar file to you projects build path
4. Build it and test the API using the test-classes

-----------
 3.0 Todos
-----------

- Make a Makefile

- Complete the implementation of the AR.Drone configuration channel (lots of
  stupid copy-work)
  
- Implement the image decoding using C++ as an JNI
