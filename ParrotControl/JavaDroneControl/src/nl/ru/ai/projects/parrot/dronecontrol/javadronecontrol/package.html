   This package contains classes that implement the computer-drone communication. The most important class regarding
   using the API is {@link nl.ru.ai.projects.parrot.dronecontrol.javadronecontrol.DroneGroundStation} which serves as 
   frontend for the API and implements all between-project interfaces ({@link VideoPollInterface}, 
   {@link SensoryDataInterface}, {@link ControlInterface}) for controlling and polling information from the Parrot AR.Drone.
