Important

- Implement sensory data stream!!!
  - gyro information - This is done... more to come!

- Route simulation timings to Java

- Update parrot.lua (hover more)

- Document everything!

- Add compiler flag to exclude OpenGL and SDL libraries from linking (to be able to compile
  the simulator in the TK)

- Add ability to generate OpenGL contexts without window
  Target behavior of Simulation Java-class:
    activateVideoInterface: activates camera image rendering
    activateRendering:      activates external simulation rendering


Smaller things

- get rid of tolua.releaseownership(worldBlock);
  during world creation

- add texture loading errors

- add possibility to add lights to the simulation

- Make build scripts nicer (for example, introduce "checkPython" functions)


Done

- Possibility to switch off rendering (deintialize OpenGL and SDL)

- Better integrate lua errors

- Add possiblitiy to disable the whole rendering engine (to speed things up)

- Let build terminate if tolua++ or python not found!
